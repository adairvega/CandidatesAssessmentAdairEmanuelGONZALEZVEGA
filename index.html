            <p>Write the program that monitor a possibly infinite stream of characters from the keyboard (standard 
                input). <br><br>If it detects the sequence "aaa" it outputs a "0". If it detects the sequence "aba" it outputs a 
                "1". DO NOT detect sequences within sequences. 
                <br><br>The program should exit cleanly when it detects 
                an <End Of Line>. <br><br>For example:<br><br>
                    The following sequence <strong>aababaaabaaa</strong> <End Of Line> would produce the following result: 100
                <br>While the following sequence <strong>aaababaaaabbababa</strong> <End Of Line> would produce the following 
                result: 0101</p>

                    Given an array of strings with file names you must check that you don't have duplicate file names 
                    in the array. In case you found repeated names you should rename the file adding “(x)” …. X is the 
                    smallest integer such that the obtained name is not used yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. Example: ["txt", "txt", "image", "txt(1)", "txt"] - Answer: ["txt", "txt(1)", "image", "txt(1)(1)",
                    "txt(2)"]

                    <br><br>i. ["file","file","file(1)","file(3)","file(2)","file(2)"] - Answer:
                    ["file","file(1)","file(1)(1)","file(3)","file(2)","file(2)(1)"]
